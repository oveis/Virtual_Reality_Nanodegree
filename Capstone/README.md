Description of this project: 
    - This is the Capstone project of the Udacity VR development Nanodegree.
    - There are 3 scenes: Main stage, Treasure Island (Joy), and Horrible House (Fear)
        - Main stage: There are 2 keys and 2 doors. One is going to Treasure Island, another is doing for Horrible House.

(Completeness) - 750
1. Gamification achievement: In each scenes, there are hidden keys or treasures. A player can explorer the scenes freely, and exit the scene when they find a key.
2. Diegetic UI achievement: I used locked doors & chest, so a player easily understand they need to find a key to open them when they click it. And, in the beginning of each scene, the player can listen a narration, which explain how to play in the scene.  
3. Alternative Storyline achievement: In the beginning, a player can choose between two keys. Depending on the key, the player can join different scene.

(Challenges) - 500
2. User Testing achievement: Tested by Aeri and Kebin several times during the development process. Attached the user testing notes. (250 * 2 if I completed 750 points in Completeness)

# Side note: I spent lots of hours to research "Speech Recognition" and "Video Player". I tried multiple Unity plugins, but most of them have bugs, not easy to set up, or even required paid dependent plugins. I found some other options for Android, but as an iPhone user, I couldn't try them unfortunately.
